### Other Important Information

Please review the following two resources:

* [ADA Compliance Guide](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm). All web and mobile app projects at Hack for LA should be *ADA compliant*. We are an inclusive organization by charter.

* [Fist-to-5 Consensus-Based Decision Making](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vvjuKVqtvqt4EcuC3_cS4c3Yvm5ZUa1O5fIBR4iKjUg/edit?usp=sharing). We have not started using this widely but are in the process of trialing it to see if it works when normal discussion starts to drag on.
