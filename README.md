   - General questions can be posted in the [#general](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C04502L0P) channel.
7. Setup up your GitHub account:
   - Set up [two factor authentication](https://www.github.com/hackforla/governance#20_).

Other handy things:
* [Fist-to-5 Consensus-Based Decision Making](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vvjuKVqtvqt4EcuC3_cS4c3Yvm5ZUa1O5fIBR4iKjUg/edit?usp=sharing) presentation.  We have not started using this widely but are in the process of trialing it, to see if it works when normal discussion starts to drag on.
* All the webapps and mobile app projects at Hack for LA, should be **ADA compliant**.  We are an inclusive organization by charter.  Get acquainted with accessibility here: https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm. 

### If you are UX/UI/PM/Copywriter/Graphic Designer/Activist or other non-coding professional

You are not only welcome, you are much needed in the development of software. Please connect with us in person at a hacknight or reach out to us in the [general](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C04502L0P) channel on slack.


### If you are Developer or Data Scientist

HackforLA.org is a standard [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).

To develop the site, you will need to first clone the repository on to your computer. For new Git users, see [Using Git](https://github.com/hackforla/getting-started/blob/master/using-git.md).

We make use of Docker for most of our projects. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) before you arrive for faster onboarding.  

You will need both Docker and Docker Compose.

The recommended installation method is [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) for Windows 10 64-bit, Mac, and Linux users. Users of unsupported operating systems may check out [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) instead.

More on using Docker and the concepts of containerization:

* [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
* [Get started with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)

Please review our special guide on ADA accessibility compliance: [Which accessibility testing tool should you use?](https://github.com/hackforla/getting-started/blob/master/ADA-guide.md).
