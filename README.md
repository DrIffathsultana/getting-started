### If you a UX/UI/PM/Copywriter/Graphic Designer/Activist or other non coding professional

### If you are Developer or Data Scientist

We make use of Docker for most of our projects, install it before you come for faster onboarding.  

You will need both Docker and Docker Compose.
The recommended installation method is [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) for Windows 10 64-bit,
Mac, and Linux users. Users of unsupported operating systems may check out [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) instead.

* [Get started with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
