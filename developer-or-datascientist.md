### If you are Developer or Data Scientist

We make use of Docker for most of our projects. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) before you arrive for faster onboarding.  

You will need both Docker and Docker Compose.

The recommended installation method is [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) for Windows 10 64-bit, Mac, and Linux users. Users of unsupported operating systems may check out [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) instead.

More on using Docker and the concepts of containerization:

* [Get started with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
